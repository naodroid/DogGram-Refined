## Overview

This project aims to refine [DogGram](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-doggram/), the Swift-UI course in Udemy.

It's a great project for beginners. If you don't have any experience in SwiftUI, I recommend you to take it.

But it's for beginners so that I suppose the code in the project has many rooms to improvement, and need to adapt iOS15/Xcode13.

## Important Notice

**This project lacks some resources intendedly,** so this project can't be built/run directly.

You need to take [the DogGram Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-doggram/) and place resources in this project (also setup firebase, AppleSignIn and GoogleSignIn on your own).


## Issues

- [ ] Fix warnings in Xcode13
- [ ] Clean Architecture
- [ ] Swift Concurrency
- [ ] Use color assets more efficient (in dark theme)
